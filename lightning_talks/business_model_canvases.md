# Business Model Canvas - Robert
1. Comes from Business Model Generation by Alex Osterwalder
2. All business can be described on this canvas
3. Any change to any of those boxes affect other bits of the model

There are 9 boxes:

1. Problem
2. Solution
3. Key Metrics
4. Unique Value Proposition
5. Unfair Advantage
6. Channels
7. Customer Segments
8. Cost Structures
9. Revenue Streams

* You can start at any one of the boxes, depending on what you already know.
* Anything on the canvas is a guess. You don't know the answers.
* Even if you work in the industry it's still only a guess.
* After you make a guess you have to validate it somehow.
* You can iterate on the canvas and create new snapshots.
