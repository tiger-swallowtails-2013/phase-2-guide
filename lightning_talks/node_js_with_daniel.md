# Node JS With Daniel

Node JS is a way to run JavaScript on your backend.  It's an event driven JS
environmnt. It's not a web server; it's just googles v8 engine on your desktop.

## Why?!

It's not multi-threaded; instead it's event driven.  Event driven is like a
restaurant, where threaded processes are like a street vendor.

If you put in an order at a restaurant you put your order in and the chef
doesn't have to work on just your meal

If you order at a street vendor, your vendor is blocked the entire time they're
preparing your meal.

The chef is kind of like the event loop.

## Event Loops

Stuff is getting worked on, and only when it's ready does it start to be
interacted with again.

## CRUD
if you're just doing this you're better off with sinatra than node because it's
  stuff you know. It has a ton of resources, etc.

## Resources:

1. NodeBeginner.org
2. BentoBox.io
3. Codeschool has a course on node
4. Hummingbird?
