# Week 2
You've made it for 1 week. Let's see about two, shall we? Week 2 is all about
reinforcing REST, testing, and clean code, as well as adding in JavaScript and
CSS.

## Learning Objectives

### 3 Thumbs Up
I can:

1. Use AJAX and front end templating to create a multi-model single-page app
2. Bind events which can respond to events triggered from elements added later
   to the DOM; i.e. event delegation
3. Use prototypical inheritance to share behavior among Javascript Objects
4. Can create a grid system that uses only classes to pass the [AG
   Test](http://oocss.org/grids_docs.html)
4. Test drive DOM manipulation, AJAX, and plain old javascript
5. Do all of the 3 Thumbs Up from Week 1
6. Do all of the 2 Thumbs Up from Week 2

### 2 Thumbs Up
I can:

1. Use front end templating to replace content
2. Use javascript objects to organize code
3. Use traditional box model, floats, and relative positioning to create a
   'newspaper' style layout
4. Test drive DOM manipulation, AJAX, or plain old javascript
5. Do all of the 2 thumbs up from week 1
6. Do all of the 1 thumbs up from week 2


### 1 Thumb Up
I can:

1. Use functional scoping to organize javascript code
2. Find elements on the page using classes and IDs
2. Bind events to HTML elements
3. Add, remove, and replace elements I've found in the DOM
4. Use floats, relative positoning, and border-box box sizing to create two or
   three column layouts.
5. Write jasmine tests for plain old javascript
6. Do all of the 1 thumbs up from week 1
