These are the notes Strand took during Myles' OO and Functional programming lecture on October 2nd, 2013.

Object-Oriented Programming
===========================

…C++ was _not_ what I had in mind.
The internet is a good example of OO sites send data (messages) to other systems.
The one thing people love more than real world analogs is hierarchies.
As soon as you make a hierarchy, you find a special case that doesn't fit in.

Functional Programming
======================
[Functional Programming in C++](http://www.altdevblogaday.com/2012/04/26/functional-programming-in-c/)
Languages: Lisp, Haskell (also Lisp), OCaml, Scala (gross)
Terms: Lambda Calculus, Church Numerals, Monads, Co-Monads, Functor, Type Theory, Category Theory, …Other Formal Systems
A bunch of shitty bullshit?

**Functional programming is about the transformation of data using functions.**

DATA

The shape of data

Primitives
-----------
Integer
String
Float
Boolean

Collections
-----------
Lists
Sets (unordered, unique) A mapping with no values
Maps
Tuples (order is important and the length is fixed)

Maps for these territories?

[5, 3, 7, 8]

In JavaScript a mapping of keys and values is… an object.

Lua -another embeddable language with simplistic and performance characteristics.
