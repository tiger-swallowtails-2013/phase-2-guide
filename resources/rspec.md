# Rspec
RSpec is a testing framework designed to help you write clear, human readable
specifications for how your software behaves. It's pretty much the industry
standard for ruby testing. [Cucumber](http://cukes.info/)
provides some competition when working with a technical customer, and
[minispec](https://github.com/bernerdschaefer/minispec) is actually built right
into ruby, so it's perfect for quick prototyping.
