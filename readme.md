# How This Phase Works

## A Day In The Life

### Mornings
Monday - Thursday at 9 AM we meet in the meadow for standup or lecture. Friday, we
meet immediately after check-in.

Teams are encouraged to prepare their afternoon [lightning
talk](#lightning-talks) during the morning. Teams without an afternoon lightning
talk are encouraged to continue to work on their [group project](#group-projects).

### Afternoons
Monday - Friday at 2 PM we meet in the cave for lightning talks. Lightning talks
are ~5 minutes long, followed by 5 minutes for discussion.

After lightning talks, teams are encouraged to work on group projects. Teams are
encouraged to stop working on projects at 6 PM and must stop work at 7PM. Thereafter
you should all pursue [side projects](#side-projects).

### Evenings
At 6 PM, you should begin to wrap up group projects for the day.  After 7PM, you
should no longer be working on your group project. Instead you should prepare
tomorrow's [lighting talk](#lightning-talks) or work on a [side project](#side-projects).

## What Do We Work On?

### Group Projects
Group projects are only to be worked on until 6~7pm. You will not 'finish' your
group project. There is always more to do, more enhancements to be made, more
features to be added, and more bugs to fix. This is why there is a 7PM hard
stop.

### Lightning Talks
Lightning talks are 5 minutes where you answer a given question. By restricting
it to 5 minutes, you must choose the most important things to talk about.
Generally the best lightning talks is 1 idea, split into 2~3 parts. Any more
parts and it gets rushed or too high level.

Lightning talks use a whiteboard. No projector allowed! Feel free to practice
sketching before giving the talk.

### Side Projects
Every programmer worth their salt has some kind of side project. Good side
projects do one or more of these things:

1. Shore up difficulties faced during the work day.
2. Explore things you're super excited about.

Side Projects can last as long as a few years or as little as a few minutes.
It's totally up to you to figure out what you want to do. If you need some help
deciding, here's a few suggestions:

1. Grab a challenge from Socrates!
2. Start working through/giving feedback on [exercism.io](http://exercism.io)
   they'll force you to write nice code!
3. Take a stab at any of these [hundreds of
   projects](https://github.com/thekarangoel/Projects) spread across problem
   domains.
4. Grab a staff member, student, or mentor and ask them what *they're* super
   excited about or wished they knew better.
