# Week 1
Greetings Tiger Swallowtails!

You've successfully learned how to type. Now you get to learn how to *type
harder*. Week 1 is about digging into how the web works, building
applications for the web, and collaborating on a team.

What does this mean? It means you are:

1. Writing unit tests from day 1.
1. Releasing to heroku as soon as possible.
1. Sharing what you've learned with the rest of your team.
1. Stopping group project work at the end of the work day.
1. Using github's pull request model.
1. Working as a group, not a collection of individuals. Pairing.

## Group Projects
* An [Online Discussion Forum](projects/online_discussion_forum.md)
* A [Social Network](projects/social_network.md)
* A [Survey Management System](projects/survey_system.md)

## Learning Objectives

This week, your goal is to be capable of:

1. Creating a small database driven web application in ruby.
2. Making web applications available on the internet.
3. Working as a team with git, where you review each others code.
4. Testing plain ruby objects, active record models, and web applications.
