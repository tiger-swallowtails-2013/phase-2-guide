# Week 1
Greetings Tiger Swallowtails!

You've successfully learned how to type. Now you get to learn how to *type
harder*. Week 1 is about digging into how the web works, building
applications for the web, and collaborating on a team.

What does this mean? It means you are:

1. Writing unit tests from day 1.
1. Releasing to heroku as soon as possible.
1. Sharing what you've learned with the rest of your team.
1. Stopping group project work at the end of the work day.
1. Using github's pull request model.
1. Working as a group, not a collection of individuals. Pairing.

For a more detailed break down, check out the [week 1 learning
objectives](week1/learning_objectives.md).
