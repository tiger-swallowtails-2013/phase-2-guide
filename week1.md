# Week 1
Greetings Tiger Swallowtails!

You've successfully learned how to type. Now you get to learn how to *type
harder*. Week 1 is about digging into how the web works, building
applications for the web, and collaborating on a team.

What does this mean? It means you are:

1. Writing unit tests from day 1.
1. Releasing to heroku as soon as possible.
1. Sharing what you've learned with the rest of your team.
1. Stopping group project work at the end of the work day.
1. Using github's pull request model.
1. Working as a group, not a collection of individuals. Pairing.

## Group Projects
* An [Online Discussion Forum](projects/online_discussion_forum.md)
* A [Social Network](projects/social_network.md)
* A [Survey Management System](projects/survey_system.md)

## Resources
* [Sinatra](resources/sinatra.md)
* [RSpec](resources/rspec.md)

## Learning Objectives

### Three Thumbs Up

1. Create a multi-model database driven web application with RESTful routes
2. Host the application on Rackspace, BlueBox, Heroku, and/or Engine Yard
3. Submit tight, full-stack pull requests that add one small useful change
4. TDD my controllers, models, and plain old ruby objects
5. Use Active Record Scopes to filter data on the Model
6. Do everything in the Two Thumbs Up

### Two Thumbs Up

1. Create a single-model database driven web application with RESTful routes
2. Submit full stack pull requests
3. TDD at least one of: controllers, models, or plain old ruby objects
4. Use active record relations effectively
5. Do everything in the One Thumb Up

### One Thumb Up

1. Create a single-model database driven web application
2. Submit and merge pull requests
3. Write tests for controllers, models, and plain old ruby objects
4. Write Active Record migrations and use built in validations
