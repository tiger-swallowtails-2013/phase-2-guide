# Stockticker
Becuase you need to know!
[This Site](http://dev.markitondemand.com/ "Stock data") provides a api for getting 
interesting data about stock. I would like to have a nifty little javascript library 
that wraps it up all neat for me so all I have to do is give it a symbol and what element 
I want the ticker to be displayed in and poof I have a ticker.

## MVP

* Single line ticker

## Hard-Mode Features

* Figure out what implementing something as a plugin for angularjs means
* Implement this as a provider plugin for angular or soma.js
