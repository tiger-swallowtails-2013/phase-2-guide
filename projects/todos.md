# Todo list
If only there was a way I could keep track of the stuff I'm trying to do with a
computing device!

This project is super-light on the backend and launches you into AJAX/JS! But
don't let it's simplicity fool you, once you get to adding tags and users
you'll be dealing with many to many relationships all over the place!
